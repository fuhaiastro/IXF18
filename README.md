# A Maximum Likelihood Method to Restore Intrinsic Properties from Observed Properties

This repository accompanies the journal article [Isbell, Xue, and Fu
2018 Astrophysical Journal Letter](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...869L..37I/): 
*The Evolution of Molecular Gas Fraction Traced by the CO Tully-Fisher
Relation*.

Here I provide the galaxy catalogs under `data/`, a Python notebook
that implements the statistical method that maximizes the likelihood of
the model parameters with a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler, along with 
the published paper.
